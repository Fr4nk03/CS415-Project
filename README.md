Summary: (1 to 2 paragraphs describing the game and what a player does in it)

The game is based on the background story of a cat in an experiment facility trying to escape and his goal is to release as many other cats as possible and get out of the facility. The environment in each level is designed to test the living capabilities of the cats and therefore may have different weather conditions or terrain settings.

Essential elements of each level contain a boss with a team of security guards, a control center, and a cat container. The boss stays in a control center with an ID card which grants his permission to unlock the container. Only by defeating the boss can the player get the card for unlocking the container. Player has melee combat abilities like pouncing and biting as well as wide-range attacks of shooting hardened furs/roaring to freeze enemies/throwing bombs. By causing damage to the enemies, the player can receive an XP boost which can level up their health and attack damage. The player can also store collected special drugs or bought bombs in the toolbox and use when needed.


Updates from Alpha:
There are three levels in total and in each level, the player needs to fight against enemies and cross over obstacles to reach the upper level. The player has close-range pouncing ability as well as pushing the enemies away. There are also coins for players to collect to boost their scores and health packs and health curing area for recovering health.
